# Comparing Baltimore vs Ellicott-City-MD Household Income and Fraction Married 

## Household Income

Using [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org), I was able to get Baltimore and Ellicott City's average household income data.
Specifically, I used 25th percentile parent income to compare the income of the poor people in these two cities.

### Baltimore
![alt_text](https://github.com/ywonjun1021/Baltimore-vs-Ellicott-City-MD/blob/master/Baltimore%20Household%20Income.png)

With the collected data, I created a PivotTable and PivotChart to see average household income in Baltimore.

The average household income in Baltimore is around $32,626.09.

## Ellicott City
![alt_text](https://github.com/ywonjun1021/Baltimore-vs-Ellicott-City-MD/blob/master/Household%20Income%20Ellicott%20City.png)

I created a PivotTable and PivotChart to see average household income in Ellicott City.

The average household income in Ellicott City is around $47,792.92.


## Fraction Married vs Household Income 

Again,[Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org) provided Baltimore and Ellicott City's fraction married data. 

### Baltimore

With the collected data, I created a scatter plot to see the relationship between Fraction Married and Household Income in Baltimore.
The graph shows that the higher the household income is, the higher fraction married is. Vice versa.
### Ellicott City

The graph shows a similar relationship as in Baltimore's scatter plot. The more income the household has, the more likely they are married. Again, vice versa. 

Comparing the two cities, I can conclude that household in Ellicott City is generally richer than household in Baltimore. Furthermore, since higher fraction married was correlated to higher income, I can assume that more people in Ellicott City are married. It is interesting to see the difference because these two cities are only 20 minutes away by driving.
