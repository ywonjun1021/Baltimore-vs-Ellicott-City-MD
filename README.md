## Household Income

Using [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org), I was able to get the data for Baltimore and Ellicott City's average household income.
Specifically, I used 25th percentile parent income to compare the income of the poor people in these two cities.

### Baltimore
![alt_text](https://github.com/ywonjun1021/Baltimore-vs-Ellicott-City-MD/blob/master/Baltimore%20Household%20Income.png)

With the collected data, I created a PivotTable and PivotChart to see average household income in Baltimore.

The average household income in Baltimore is around $32,626.09.

## Ellicott City
![alt_text](https://github.com/ywonjun1021/Baltimore-vs-Ellicott-City-MD/blob/master/Household%20Income%20Ellicott%20City.png)

With the collected data, I created a PivotTable and PivotChart to see average household income in Ellicott City.

The average household income in Ellicott City is around $47,792.92.


## Fraction Married vs Household Income 

Again,[Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org) provided Baltimore and Ellicott City's fraction married data. 

### Baltimore

With the collected data, I created a scatter plot to see the relationship between Fraction Married and Household Income in Baltimore.
The graph shows that the richer you are, the more likely to for you to be married. On the other hand, the lower the household income is, the lower the chance that he or she is married. 

### Ellicott City

The graph shows a similar relationship as we saw in Baltimore's scatter plot. The more income the household has, the more likely they were married. Again, vice versa.
